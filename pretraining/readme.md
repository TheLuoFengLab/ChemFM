# Pre-Training

This section of the repository provides scripts and resources for **pre-training ChemFM** on [UniChem](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/UniChem/data/). 

## Overview

Our pre-training process is based on [**TinyLlama**](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama/tree/main). Currently, this is a **preview version**, and the code is not fully cleaned up.
